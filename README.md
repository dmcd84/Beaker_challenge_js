# The Challenge

In the movie Die Hard 3, Bruce Willis is given this task: he has to figure out how to get exactly 4 litres of water in a beaker. He has a tap with running water, a 3 litre beaker and a 5 litre beaker. There is no shortage of water in the tap, but time is limited, so he needs to get to the answer in the minimum number of steps.

Can you create an interactive application which simulates this problem and allows the user to be ‘Bruce Willis’ and try to arrive at the answer by virtually filling the beakers from the tap and pouring them into each other.

The solution should let the user know if he or she has reached the right answer, and have a timer counting down from 5 minutes to zero, at which point the game will stop.

# ToDos
- add timer
- add move counter
- deploy to web
- add leaderboard
- add styling (forever ongoing!)
